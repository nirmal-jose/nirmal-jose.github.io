                AutoVision: Driving Scene Risk Assessment
            </b>
            <p>
                The Android application captures 60 Frames during driving events like hard acceleration, sudden braking, 
                overspeeding etc. Later the frames are processed to detect and track interesting objects during the 
                driving scene to find there approximate proximity to the vehicle. The frames' objects were detected using 
                TensorFlow lite model from this 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android"
                class="hover">project</a>. 
                Interesting class objects were car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle and person. The objects were further tracked based on 
                custom tracker depending on their position during the event. The user can later review events captured with 
                information about some level of severity and object which came the closest. The below images shows the event 
                captured and processed as mentioned above with details about object class and distance from the source. The 
                second image depicts the android application review screen with vital information.<br/><br/>

                TurboCharger Fault Detection
            </b>
            <p>
                Detection of TurboCharger failure or malfunction using PID data and DTC info. The PID data were collected 
                from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II protocols and telematics device from various vehicles. The 
                TurboCharger performance was evaluated based on the amount of pressure created inside the intake manifold 
                using Intake Air Temperature (IAT) & Manifold Absolute Pressure or Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor depending on 
                their availability. The value of these quantities where further binned based on Engine RPM and MAF. 
                Reference data for comparison were built by taking the median value for each bin collected across the same 
                make-model, which doesn't have any DTC related to TurboCharger. The bin values' euclidean distance was taken 
                to compare between vehicle and reference, with some threshold. The below images depicts the study carried out 
                between reference data & defective vehicle, and the same vehicle before and after DTC occurrence.

                Gear Shift Recommendation
            </b>
            <p>
                Gear Shift recommendation for vehicle owners was provided based on there shifting behaviour using 
                Speed and Engine RPM data. The PID data were collected from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II 
                protocols and telematics device from various vehicles. The speed and rpm data collected were used 
                to find various gear ratio, these values were further binned to respective gears using K-means 
                clustering technique. The reference speed limits for each make-model and gears were collected 
                from a massive dataset of speed-rpm data across various drivers. The speed limits were decided 
                based on upper and lower percentile value across the data for respective gears.Further, the 
                boundaries were smoothened to avoid gaps and smoother transmission.</br></br>
                Each driver was compared across gears and respective speed limits. The instance of wrong gears 
                where found, and further classified these occurrences into acceleration or deceleration condition. 
                The most predominant recommendation found were provided to the customer, as shown below in 
                Fig. Gear Shift Recommendation Card. The below also depicts the K-means Clustering technique 
                for finding gears and representation of gear utilisation by a particular driver.
