                Vehicle Inspection using OBD-II PID Data
            </b>
            </a>
            <p>
                Vehicle Inspection reports are generated from PID data collected for each vehicle for a fixed period, 
                say a month. The supported PIDs for each vehicle will be different, so initially, the supported PIDs 
                by each vehicle are collected, and then the PID config for vehicle inspection will be generated. The 
                significant PID used for inspection is categorised into primary and secondary. The primary PIDs are 
                the default ones required for the proper functioning of the telematics device. The secondary PIDs are 
                further classified into two depending on their state being a dynamic or static nature. Then the PID 
                config files are generated, which will have the primary and secondary PIDs required to collect data 
                for vehicle inspection. Most of the vehicles will have more than one config file so that we need to 
                rotate PID config files during the period of inspection. The rotating of PID config files is based on 
                their importance and the amount of data required for running the vehicle inspection algorithm. Each 
                trip across the inspection period will be inspected, and a weighted average on distance traveled will 
                be considered an overall rating for the vehicle during the period. Along with PID data, DTC data is 
                also collected for the period to show vehicle owners various defects detected by vehicles for better 
                maintenance. The battery voltage data is also collected during the period, and battery ratings are 
                given based on the voltage post-trip. The vehicle inspection provided ratings and details about fuel 
                economy, battery voltage, max power and torque achieved, idle rpm, coolant temperature, engine load 
                distribution, charging system (alternator), O2 sensors, and fuel trims, along with distance travelled 
                for the period. Along with DTC found during the period, their severity, system info, and distance 
                travelled with Malfunction Indication Light (MIL) ON and since clearing DTCs. The inspection report 
                is available across the mobile application (as shown in figures below) and in the web app for fleet 
                owners. This will give a performance, safety, and maintenance insights to customers on a regular 
                basis for keeping their vehicle in good condition.

                The Android application captures 60 Frames during driving events like hard acceleration, sudden braking, overspeeding, 
                etc. Later the frames are processed to detect and track interesting objects during the driving scene to find their 
                approximate proximity to the vehicle. The frames' objects were detected using the TensorFlow lite model from this  
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android"
                class="hover">project</a>. 
                Interesting class objects were a car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, and person. The objects were further tracked 
                based on a custom tracker depending on their position during the event. The user can later review events captured 
                with information about some severity and object that came the closest. The below images shows the event captured 
                and processed as mentioned above with details about object class and distance from the source. The second image 
                depicts the android application review screen with vital information.

                TurboCharger Fault Detection

            <p>
                Detection of TurboCharger failure or malfunction using PID data and DTC info. The PID data were collected 
                from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II protocols and telematics devices from various vehicles. 
                The TurboCharger performance was evaluated based on the amount of pressure created inside the intake 
                manifold using Intake Air Temperature (IAT) & Manifold Absolute Pressure or Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor 
                depending on their availability. The value of these quantities where further binned based on Engine RPM and 
                MAF. Reference data for comparison were built by taking the median value for each bin collected across the 
                same make-model, which doesn't have any DTC related to TurboCharger. The bin values' euclidean distance was 
                taken to compare between vehicle and reference, with some threshold. The below images depicts the study 
                carried out between reference data & defective vehicle, and the same vehicle before and after DTC occurrence.

                Gear Shift Recommendation

            <p>
                Gear Shift recommendation for vehicle owners was provided based on their shifting behaviour using 
                Speed and Engine RPM data. The PID data were collected from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II 
                protocols and telematics devices from various vehicles. The speed and rpm data collected were used 
                to find various gear ratios; these values were further binned to respective gears using the K-means 
                clustering technique. The reference speed limits for each make-model and gears were collected from 
                a massive dataset of speed-rpm data across various drivers. The speed limits were decided based on 
                upper and lower percentile values across the data for respective gears. Further, the boundaries were 
                smoothened to avoid gaps and smoother transmission.</br></br>
                Each driver was compared across gears and respective speed limits. The instance of wrong gears was 
                found and further classified these occurrences into acceleration or deceleration conditions. The 
                most predominant recommendation found were provided to the customer, as shown below in Fig. Gear 
                Shift Recommendation Card. The below also depicts the K-means Clustering technique for finding gears 
                and representation of gear utilisation by a particular driver.
