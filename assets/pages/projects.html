                    Dubins path planning algorithm was generated using a geometric approach. The Carrot Chasing Algorithm 
                    (CCA) will be used to follow the path generated by the Dubins path planning algorithm, as shown in the 
                    previous section. CCA sets a virtual target point (VTP) on the desired course. The vehicle heading 
                    direction will be corrected at each step to reach this point.

                    This work designs a simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) using Kalman and Particle Filter. 
                    A correction step follows the prediction step. The study also considers bearing only and range only 
                    measurements, comparing the performance of the SLAM algorithm developed. Later Extended Kalan Filter 
                    (EKF) is implemented, enhancing the existing SLAM algorithm using KF and PF.

                    This group work aimed to analyse the current robotaxi's blue-ocean market strategies and enablers. In 
                    the first session, we focus on a high-level view of the existing industry; two analysis tools are used 
                    in various factors and competitive dynamics studies. Disruptive technologies are probed with a 
                    state-of-art  view  of  autonomous  driving  and  optimization  methods  in  the  following  sessions. 
                    Moreover, we introduced the influence of the key technology enablers in economic, social, safety, 
                    and legal aspects, respectively. Finally, critical research in the corresponding business model and 
                    strategy is generated in the last session, including a complete view of recommended strategies 
                    and an objective possible risk study.

                    This research-based coursework aims to present optimisation techniques in motion planning for
                    connected  and  autonomous  vehicles.  Various  state-of-the-art  methods  involved  in  the  motion 
                    planning of CAV was identified and investigated. Optimisation techniques discussed here can be 
                    mainly classified into classical, bionic and machine learning methods. Some of the optimisation 
                    techniques  found  were  briefly  described,  along  with  their  objective  function,  constraints,  and 
                    boundary conditions. An outline model was designed using an open-source traffic simulator and 
                    RL agent in python. The study also depicts the challenges motion planning architectures face and 
                    the drawbacks of different optimisation techniques.

                    This work aimed to study and understand the lane departure warning system while going through implemention 
                    and development of sensors and perceptions for the system. A systems engineering approach was taken to 
                    understand the system requirements, use cases, and validation strategies. Also identified key technology 
                    enablers for the system. The system concept was designed in Python using libraries like OpenCV and NumPy. 
                    The system designed accepts image, which is processed to detect road lane using filtering, thresholding and 
                    perspective transform. The road curvature and road type is estimated by fitting the lane detected to a 
                    second-order polynomial. The vehicle's position with respect to the lane is determined, and a lane departure 
                    warning is given if the vehicle goes outside the threshold set for offset from the lane centre.

                    Vehicle Inspection reports are generated from PID data collected for each vehicle for a fixed period, 
                    say a month. The supported PIDs for each vehicle will be different, so initially, the supported PIDs 
                    by each vehicle are collected, and then the PID config for vehicle inspection will be generated. The 
                    significant PID used for inspection is categorised into primary and secondary. The primary PIDs are 
                    the default ones required for the proper functioning of the telematics device. The secondary PIDs are 
                    further classified into two depending on their state being a dynamic or static nature. Then the PID 
                    config files are generated, which will have the primary and secondary PIDs required to collect data 
                    for vehicle inspection. Most of the vehicles will have more than one config file so that we need to 
                    rotate PID config files during the period of inspection. The rotating of PID config files is based on 
                    their importance and the amount of data required for running the vehicle inspection algorithm. Each 
                    trip across the inspection period will be inspected, and a weighted average on distance traveled will 
                    be considered an overall rating for the vehicle during the period. Along with PID data, DTC data is 
                    also collected for the period to show vehicle owners various defects detected by vehicles for better 
                    maintenance. The battery voltage data is also collected during the period, and battery ratings are 
                    given based on the voltage post-trip. The vehicle inspection provided ratings and details about fuel 
                    economy, battery voltage, max power and torque achieved, idle rpm, coolant temperature, engine load 
                    distribution, charging system (alternator), O2 sensors, and fuel trims, along with distance travelled 
                    for the period. Along with DTC found during the period, their severity, system info, and distance 
                    travelled with Malfunction Indication Light (MIL) ON and since clearing DTCs. The inspection report 
                    is available across the mobile application (as shown in figures below) and in the web app for fleet 
                    owners. This will give a performance, safety, and maintenance insights to customers on a regular 
                    basis for keeping their vehicle in good condition.

                    The Android application captures 60 Frames during driving events like hard acceleration, sudden braking, overspeeding, 
                    etc. Later the frames are processed to detect and track interesting objects during the driving scene to find their 
                    approximate proximity to the vehicle. The frames' objects were detected using the TensorFlow lite model from this

                    Interesting class objects were a car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, and person. The objects were further tracked 
                    based on a custom tracker depending on their position during the event. The user can later review events captured 
                    with information about some severity and object that came the closest. The below images shows the event captured 
                    and processed as mentioned above with details about object class and distance from the source. The second image 
                    depicts the android application review screen with vital information.

                    Detection of TurboCharger failure or malfunction using PID data and DTC info. The PID data were collected 
                    from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II protocols and telematics devices from various vehicles. 
                    The TurboCharger performance was evaluated based on the amount of pressure created inside the intake 
                    manifold using Intake Air Temperature (IAT) & Manifold Absolute Pressure or Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor 
                    depending on their availability. The value of these quantities where further binned based on Engine RPM and 
                    MAF. Reference data for comparison were built by taking the median value for each bin collected across the 
                    same make-model, which doesn't have any DTC related to TurboCharger. The bin values' euclidean distance was 
                    taken to compare between vehicle and reference, with some threshold. The below images depicts the study 
                    carried out between reference data & defective vehicle, and the same vehicle before and after DTC occurrence.

                    Gear Shift recommendation for vehicle owners was provided based on their shifting behaviour using 
                    Speed and Engine RPM data. The PID data were collected from the vehicle CAN network using OBD II 
                    protocols and telematics devices from various vehicles. The speed and rpm data collected were used 
                    to find various gear ratios; these values were further binned to respective gears using the K-means 
                    clustering technique. The reference speed limits for each make-model and gears were collected from 
                    a massive dataset of speed-rpm data across various drivers. The speed limits were decided based on 
                    upper and lower percentile values across the data for respective gears. Further, the boundaries were 
                    smoothened to avoid gaps and smoother transmission.</br></br>
                    Each driver was compared across gears and respective speed limits. The instance of wrong gears was 
                    found and further classified these occurrences into acceleration or deceleration conditions. The 
                    most predominant recommendation found were provided to the customer, as shown below in Fig. Gear 
                    Shift Recommendation Card. The below also depicts the K-means Clustering technique for finding gears 
                    and representation of gear utilisation by a particular driver.

                    The present study develops a single-zone zero-dimensional progressive combustion simulation model 
                    using Python programming language for compression ignition engines. The model is capable of predicting 
                    in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, engine performance, and emissions characteristics. 
                    The numerical model is experimentally validated using resuts from engine testing for diesel, 
                    Pongamia Pinnata biodiesel and diesel-biodiesel blends. The chemical composition of fuel is identified 
                    using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The values of power output, mean effective pressure and 
                    exhaust oxygen concentration are independently obtained from the numerical model and from the experiments. 
                    The engine performance is not significantly affected for biodiesel to diesel blending ratio of up to 30%. 
                    A higher oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is observed with increase in blending ratio. 
                    The developed numerical model would be useful in studying the performance and emission characteristics 
                    for any alternative fuel with known calorific value and chemical composition.

                Ethanol Extraction from Bamboo Biomass

                <p>
                    Bioethanol extraction from bamboo biomass comprises of different steps of pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, 
                    fermentation, and distillation. Production of fermentable sugars out of biomass also depends on various factors 
                    like biomass composition, pretreatment methodology, the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. Primary components 
                    of plant biomass are cellulose – main structural polymer, hemicellulose – heteropolymer present along with 
                    cellulose, and lignin – complex organic polymer providing key structural strength. The first step in bioethanol 
                    extraction is pretreatment, it’s a very crucial step which intends in altering the structural characteristics 
                    of biomass for increasing the availability of polymers for hydrolyzing enzymes. This is achieved by the removal 
                    of either hemicellulose or lignin fractions from the biomass. Pretreatment methods are mainly classified into 
                    physical, chemical, physiochemical and biological techniques which have been established and used in the past 
                    decades for bioethanol extraction. Generally, pretreatment involves high-temperature treatment with dilute 
                    alkali or acid. Alkali pretreatment remains to be most desirable as it retains cellulose and hemicellulose, 
                    meanwhile removing a major portion of lignin in the solid. The second step is enzymatic hydrolysis, 
                    during which sugar polymers like cellulose and hemicellulose are hydrolyzed to release free sugar monomers. 
                    Enzymatic hydrolysis is preferable over chemical hydrolysis carried out mostly by acid due to its specificity, 
                    mild operational conditions, and lesser or no byproduct formation. The third step is fermentation, 
                    conversion of fermentable sugars formed after enzymatic hydrolysis to ethanol using microorganisms or biocatalyst.
